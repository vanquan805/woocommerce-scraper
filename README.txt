The best solution for scraping products.

== Description ==

= THE #1 SCRAPING PLUGIN FOR WOOCOMMERCE =

WooCommerce Scraper is the best scraping product solution for WooCommerce, allowing users to scrape any e-commerce website. Fix any other scraping plugin issues.

= RUNNING ON ALL HOSTING, VPS =

As you know, some hosting providers don't support virtual cron, so some scraping plugins didn't work. Because of that, we developed this plugin.

= SUPPORT CRAWLING DATA THAT IS RENDERED BY JAVASCRIPT =

Our plugin supports the collection of data rendered by Javascript that other plugins can't do.

= EASY TO USE =

With just a little understanding of DevTools of browsers and HTML, you can easily use it.
